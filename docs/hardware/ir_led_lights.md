# IR Illumination

Infrared (IR) illumination is used to light the arena for behavioral tracking without introducing visible cues to the animal.  
This allows the experiment to be recorded continuously while keeping the visual environment defined solely by the LED display.

## Design Choice

The system uses **very simple, generic IR LED light sources** that are widely available and inexpensive.  
These lights are typically sold for basic night-vision or security applications and require minimal setup.

Despite their simplicity, they provide sufficient and uniform illumination for imaging the animal’s movement across the arena.

## Practical Use

The IR lights are positioned to evenly illuminate the arena surface from below or above, depending on the camera placement.  
Once installed, they operate continuously during experiments without requiring adjustment or calibration.

Because the illumination is invisible to the animal, it does not interfere with the visual stimuli used for the task.

## Why This Approach Works

More specialized IR illumination systems are available, but are often unnecessary for this application.  
The generic IR LED sources used here are reliable, easy to replace, and perform well for long recording sessions.

This choice keeps the setup simple and reduces cost, while still meeting the basic requirements for behavioral tracking.
